# YTD Baseline Audit Log

**Date:** January 29, 2026
**Change:** Reverted YTD baseline to December 31, 2025 (TradingView standard)

## Summary

All YTD calculations now use the **December 31, 2025 close price** as the anchor, matching TradingView's YTD standard.

Formula: `YTD Return = (current / dec_31_close - 1) * 100`, rounded to 2 decimals

## Baseline Alignment

This update aligns our YTD calculations with TradingView's methodology:
- **TradingView Standard**: Uses December 31 close as the YTD starting price (displayed as "2026 Open" in their UI)
- **Previous Implementation**: Used January 2, 2026 (first trading day)
- **Current Implementation**: Uses December 31, 2025 close (TradingView-aligned)

## Impact Analysis

### Portfolio YTD Calculations

With the Dec 31, 2025 baseline, YTD returns now match TradingView's methodology:
- Uses the last trading day close of the previous year
- Provides direct comparability with TradingView charts

### Example Calculation

For NVDA with Dec 31, 2025 close = $189.84:
- If current price = $188.52
- YTD Return = (188.52 / 189.84 - 1) * 100 = **-0.70%**

(This matches TradingView's YTD calculation for NVDA)
