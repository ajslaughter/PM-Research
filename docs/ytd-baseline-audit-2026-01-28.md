## Impact Analysis

### Portfolio YTD Calculations

With the new Jan 2, 2026 baseline, YTD returns will now be calculated from the first trading day of 2026 rather than the last trading day of 2025. This provides a more accurate representation of 2026 performance.

### Example Calculation

For NVDA with Jan 2, 2026 close = $138.31:
- If current price = $188.52
- YTD Return = (188.52 / 138.31 - 1) * 100 = **36.30%**

(Compared to old calculation using Dec 31 baseline of $189.84 which would show -0.70%)
